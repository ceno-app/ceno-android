Share the Web! Ceno is the world's first web browser that gets better with every installation. Offering a common Internet browsing experience, it relies on a peer-to-peer technology to deliver and share websites among all participants. Ceno can also be used to bypass network restrictions and browse content during a shutdown.

Ceno is a completely free and open source browser that doesn’t require registration. It is completely ad-free.

We collect some anonymized app and network metrics. No personal information is collected and the data is never shared with third-parties. Metrics collection is enabled by default, users can opt-out of it any time via the `Settings > Background metrics > Ceno Metrics` toggle. Please refer to our <a href="https://ceno.app/en/privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information about what we collect.
