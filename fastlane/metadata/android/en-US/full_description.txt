A Mobile Web Browser for Bypassing Restrictions and Accessing the Internet — Even if It’s Slowed Down or Suddenly Shut Off in Your Region.

Ceno is a free browser that doesn’t require registration and is completely ad-free.

We collect only opt-in, anonymized data regarding app performance and do not share it with third parties.

Ceno operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, allowing users to share information directly with each other.

🔓 👀 Access blocked media and other websites. Free and anonymous in Personal Mode.

🚫🌴 In case of a internet shutdown in your region, you will still be able to read news and stay connected.

📱🤝📱  Live in a country with free internet access? Help people in other countries bypass censorship and access independent information with just one tap. Learn more  <a href="https://ceno.network">on our website</a>.

📖👐 Ceno Browser is built on Ouinet, an open-source library. You can check the app’s code <a href="https://gitlab.com/censorship-no">on GitLab</a>,

🛠🦹🏻  Our product may experience instability due to the constant evolution of censorship technologies. We are continuously improving it to ensure you maintain access. If websites load slowly or don’t open, please don’t delete the app — try using it again in a few days or contact our support team: support@ceno.app

Important: Ceno has two modes of operation - public and personal. You can easily toggle between them. Public mode offers the best connectivity but the least privacy - websites that you visit or share are recorded in a publicly accessible registry (BitTorrent). Private mode eliminates this record but may be slower and less efficient at retrieving content. See the <a href="https://ceno.network/support.html>FAQ</a> for more details on Ceno usage.
